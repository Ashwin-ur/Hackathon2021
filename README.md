# Streamlined Vaccine Distribution using ML 
## Description
Presently our country is executing one of the largest vaccination drive to fight against COVID-19. Due to supply chain issues, some of the hospitals face shortages of vaccines. Our algorithm helps to distribute vaccines in an efficient way. The algorithm considers the amount of vaccine that is required by the hospitals as well as vehicle carrying capacity. It uses machine learning techniques to cluster the hospital locations in a state and then maps out an efficient route to all the hospitals. Utilizing this we could forecast the number of vehicles required for the distribution, streamlining the whole supply chain. 
## Hardware and software requirements
Python 3 programming language, IBM CPLEX, python libraries scikit learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and jupyter notebook
